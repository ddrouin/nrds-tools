nrds-tools
==========

A library and a user-interface (called 'KosLookup') that will provide the ability to
check if a pilot in EVE is 'kill on sight' in Providence or not.

Simply type 'xxx' and drag and drop a pilot's name into a chat window that this tool
is monitoring, and the pilot will be looked up on http://kos.cva-eve.org/ to see if
they're Kill on Site or not.
